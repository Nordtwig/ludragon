# Ludragon
> Ludo meets warring armies and bloodthirsty dragons.


### Introduction
Ludragon is a fantasy take on the classic game of Ludo. Introducing team-based combat, armies, mystical gems and a terrifying dragon. 2-4 teams of 1-2 people move along the map, with the ultimate goal to gather gems and/or eradicate the other team(s). Meanwhile, a dragon, guarding it's hoard of gems, roam the field seeking to kill any armies it comes across.


### Notes
Each player starts the game with four units, each called an **Army**. Armies are used to maneuver around the board to fight enemy units and steal gems. An army can constitute more than one unit. This is declared by the player on deployment. An army, regardless of size, always share the same slot on the board. Losing armies is dangerous. 

Every army lost to another player or the **Dragon** is discarded forever. When a player has no armies in their **Barracks** and lost their last army on the board, that player is out of the game.

Players are split into **Teams**. The standard setup is **two** teams of **two** players, each with a base in a corner of the board, mirrored to their teammate. Each player controls their armies independently, but they share their pool of **Gems**. 

A player *must* have at least **one** army in play. If it is your turn, with no army on the board, you must roll and deploy an army. Count movement *from* and *including* your coloured slot.  

When it is your turn, no matter if you have an army in play yet, you roll **two** dice. You can pick either one for your movement, but *not* added together. If you have no army in play, you deploy an army and count the movement you chose. You **always** move clockwise.

When armies from two different teams end up on the same slot, a **battle** starts. A battle is resolved through opposed dice rolls. **Highest** wins. If the army consists of more than one unit, you add a die for each extra unit. You do **not** add the result together, however, instead, you pick the highest. If your result is higher than the enemy, they lose a unit, and vice versa. This clash continues until one side is eradicated.

The Dragon takes no sides. It **always** moves anti-clockwise. Before the game starts, you roll who will control the dragon. This person is henceforth defined as the **Dragon Master**. The Dragon Master, or DM, starts the game by rolling movement for the dragon. The dragon starts in the Dragon's Trove. The DM rolls two dice and add the results for the dragon's movement. The DM then rolls movement for themselves. The round is then resolved as per usual. If the dragon lands on a player's army, that army is eradicated. (POSSIBLE) *Advanced Rule*, if the dragon lands on a player with an Army Size of **4**, he will leave a sole survivor that returns to the player's barracks.

There are *two* different **win conditions**:
1. Attain the required amount of gems.
1. The other team(s) have lost their last unit.

The **1st** win condition is the primary one. The amount of gems is determined before the start of the game. *Recommended* number is 3-5, depending on desired game time. You gain gems through two (or three(?)) methods:
1. Reach the *Dragon's Trove* at the center of the map with one of your armies. Army Size does **not** affect gem count. To reach the trove, you must first complete a full lap of the board. No matter your roll, you will end your turn at the entrance. Next round, you will roll to move towards the trove. A five immediately nets you a gem and returns your army to your Barracks. A six means you overextended, and you end up at the mouth of the cave again. Anything less means you move into the cave. Inside is the *only* time your army is safe from the dragon or other players. This phase continues until you reach the trove, or your army is killed at the entrance. 
1. Steal a gem from the dragon. This happens when a player lands on the dragon with an army. (POSSIBLE) That army is then teleported back to the barracks. 
1. (POSSIBLE) *Advanced Rule*, if you land at the entrance to an enemy barracks, you can spend your next turn rolling to **claim** one of their gems. This is done by rolling **one** die, with success on a *six*. Regardless if you succeed or fail, your movement is forfeit this turn. You *cannot* try claiming a gem again. Instead, next turn, you roll movement as usual. 

The **2nd** win condition is simple. If the last army of the last enemy player falls, your team wins by default. It does not matter if they died to one of your armies, or the dragon. They are, per definition, incapable of continuing the game. 

Stay tuned for a refactoring of the rules, and some graphics and stuff! Wooh!
